             The FN Five-seveN is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Herstal"> FN Herstal </a> in Belgium.
             The pistol is named for its 5.7×28mm (.224 in) bullet diameter, and the trademark capitalization 
             style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer's initials—FN.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
             The Five-seveN pistol was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense
             weapon and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_5.7%C3%9728mm"> FN 5.7×28mm cartridge </a>.
             The P90 was introduced in <i>1990</i>, and the Five-seveN was introduced in <i>1998</i> as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition.
             Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seveN shares many of its design features:
             it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a relatively large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls,
             low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
             Sales of the Five-seveN were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004,
             the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses.
             Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seveN's introduction to civilian
             shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign,
             and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.
             </p>

             <p class="paragraph">
             The Five-seveN is currently in service with military and police forces in over <b>40 nations</b>,
             including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States.
             In the United States, the Five-seveN is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.
             In the years since the pistol's introduction to the civilian market in the United States, 
             it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.

             The Five-seveN pistol and its 5.7×28mm ammunition were developed by FN Herstal
             in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and associated 
             pistols and submachine guns. NATO called for two types of weapons chambered for a new cartridge—one
             a shoulder-fired weapon, and the other a handheld weapon. According to NATO, these new weapons, 
             termed personal defense weapons (PDWs), were to provide "personal protection in last-resort situations
             when the user is directly endangered by the enemy [...]." In <i>1989</i>, NATO published document <b>D/296</b>, 
             outlining a number of preliminary specifications for these weapons:
            </p>

            <ul>

               <li>The new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge.
                 Additionally, it was to be capable of penetrating certain types of body armor.
               </li> 

               <li>
                 The shoulder-fired personal defense weapon was to weigh less than 3 kg (6.6 lb),
                 with a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds.
               </li>

               <li>
                 The handheld personal defense weapon (pistol) was to weigh less than 1 kg (2.2 lb),
                 although a weight of 700 g (1.5 lb) was deemed desirable; it was to have a magazine capacity of no fewer than 20 rounds.
               </li>

               <li>
                 Both weapons were to be sufficiently compact to be carried hands-free on the user's person at all times,
                 whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft,
                 and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.
               </li>

            </ul>
